# Project 11

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had a hard time pulling the data from the firebase to the trips screen in order for the user to see the houses they book. I initially figured it out and went to office hours and the TA typed code that broke that function and I have been unable to fix it. Whenever the user reserves, I get the log in the CMD though.
